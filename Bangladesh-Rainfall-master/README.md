# Bangladesh-Rainfall
Analyzing the rainfall in Bangladesh over the years and predicting the amount of rainfall (in mm) in future. The data-set being used is a time series data-set. A comparison is made between multiple Machine learning algorithm.

## Motivation
Project was created to make comparison (of accuracy) between different types of Machine learning Algorithms. The goal of the project is to tune the algorithms in such a way that the accuracy of prediction is maximized.

## Data-set
Data-set being used in this project can be found on kaggle or you can use this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/redikod/historical-rainfall-data-in-bangladesh) to go directly to the data-set
